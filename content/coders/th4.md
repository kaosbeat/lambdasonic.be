th4 is a French livecoder, developer and mathematician based in Leuven. A classically trained theoretical computer scientist, she was drawn to TidalCycles back in 2017 from her love of lambda-calculus, and it has since been her language of predilection. Her performances typically consist in from-scratch improvisations, with an accent on dark, melancholic melodies and textures.
